# Track a Magic the Gathering collection

This is a demo version of a Java CRUD app I designed that tracks a Magic the 
Gathering card collection. On the front of the app is a simple bootstrap GUI 
that provides all the functionality of a CRUD application. The backend is 
a MySQL database. This demo of the app is purposefully being designed in 
conjunction with my Wright State University coursework where I am learning to 
deploy it using AWS, Docker and Apache2.
